# ParentPass

A secure and convenient application for parents to manage and share access credentials with childcare providers.

## Overview

ParentPass solves the common problem parents face when sharing sensitive information with childcare providers. Instead of writing down passwords or sharing accounts permanently, ParentPass provides a secure, temporary credential-sharing system with robust monitoring and control features.

## Features

### Secure Credential Storage
- End-to-end encryption for all stored credentials
- Zero-knowledge architecture ensures data privacy
- Biometric authentication options (fingerprint, face ID)
- Regular security audits and compliance with data protection standards

### Temporary Access Management
- Set precise time windows for credential access
- Create one-time use credentials
- Schedule recurring access periods for regular caregivers
- Automatic access expiration

### Real-time Monitoring
- Instant notifications when credentials are used
- Detailed access logs and history
- Suspicious activity detection
- Location-based access restrictions

### User-friendly Interface
- Intuitive mobile and web applications
- Quick setup wizards for new credentials
- Family dashboard for managing multiple caregivers
- Simplified sharing process via QR codes or links

### Cross-platform Compatibility
- iOS and Android mobile apps
- Web application for desktop access
- Smart home device integration
- API for third-party service integration

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native (mobile), React.js (web)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for user data, Redis for session management
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens, OAuth 2.0 integration
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS for data in transit
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Docker

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or Atlas connection)
- Redis (optional, for enhanced performance)

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parentpass.git
   cd parentpass
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Initialize the database
   ```
   npm run db:init
   ```

5. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Testing

```
npm test
```

For end-to-end testing:
```
npm run test:e2e
```

## Usage

### For Parents

1. **Create an account**: Sign up with email verification and set up a strong master password
2. **Add credentials**: Store important passwords, PINs, and access information
3. **Invite caregivers**: Send secure invitations to babysitters or nannies
4. **Set permissions**: Define exactly what they can access and for how long
5. **Monitor activity**: Receive notifications and review access logs

### For Caregivers

1. **Accept invitation**: No account creation needed, just verify identity
2. **Temporary access**: View only the credentials shared with you during allowed times
3. **Easy authentication**: Quick access when needed without complex login procedures
4. **Auto-expiration**: No need to remember to "log out" - access expires automatically

## Security

ParentPass implements multiple layers of security:

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Your master password never leaves your device
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Optional 2FA for additional account security
- **Automatic Lockout**: Failed login attempts trigger security measures
- **Regular Security Audits**: Ongoing penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full compliance with data protection regulations

## Roadmap

- **Q3 2023**: Smart home system integration (smart locks, security systems)
- **Q4 2023**: Enterprise version for schools and childcare facilities
- **Q1 2024**: Advanced analytics dashboard for parents
- **Q2 2024**: Integration with popular password managers
